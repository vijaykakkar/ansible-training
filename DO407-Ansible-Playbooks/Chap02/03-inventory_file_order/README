Demo of lexical order of inventory files.

Attempt to get the list of all hosts by 
# ansible 'all' --list-hosts

but it fails saying,
ERROR! inventory/file0:2: Section [east:children] includes undefined group: webeast

Reason: A file, earlier in lexical order, is trying to reference a group which is defined in a later file.

Move file0 to the last file in the order and try again.
# mv inventory/file0 inventory/file5

and try to get the list of hosts in any group like, 
# ansible '*east*' --list-hosts
